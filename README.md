For a more detailed howto guide, the resulting website here on Github Pages, should offer a resonable additional information and references. 
The idea is to kep its simple.  

Lets get started

- What prereguisite skills are necessary?
    - Some knowledge of HTML, CSS, Java/js and script/bash,   
 - What development tools?
   -  Plain text editor or advanced dev tools like [ATOM](https://atom.io/)
 - What is the Developmet Target and production target?
    - best to start using local machine for this tryour before any test deployment on github 
 - Is it virtual, local or remote hosting?
    - this depends on options. Easy to use local folder setup as all necessary tools and packages can be included in the setup.
 - Do you have 'root' access?
    - If you can write to FOLDER, then all tools and packages can be installed. However, in somecase you may need live internet access to download all packages, language tools and BOOTSTRAPS, CSS and other linked files. ALL can be downloaded to setup for local development deployment. In full deployment, most linked stylesheets, images and or scripts can be establish in cloud services.
